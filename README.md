# Pomodoro Timer

Hello, time master! You're about to explore my personal Pomodoro project, a tool crafted to boost your productivity and focus. Get ready to manage your time like never before!

## Project Overview

![](print.png)

This project is an interactive web application implementing the famous Pomodoro Technique. It helps you break down your work into focused time blocks (typically 25 minutes), separated by short breaks. It's a simple yet powerful tool, developed to enhance my skills in JavaScript and DOM manipulation while creating something useful and practical!

## Key Features

1.  **Start/Pause Timer**: Control your time flow with a click.
2.  **Work & Break Cycles**: Automatically switch between periods of intense focus (Pomodoro) and refreshing breaks (short and long).
3.  **Intuitive Interface**: A clean and visually pleasing design to track your progress.
4.  **Visual Feedback**: Interface changes clearly indicate which cycle you're in (Work, Short Break, Long Break).
5.  **(Optional - Add if implemented)** **Notifications**: Sound or visual alerts at the end of each cycle so you don't miss the transition.
6.  **(Optional - Add if implemented)** **Settings**: Customize the duration of work and break cycles to your preference.

## Tech Stack

Here's where the magic happens! I dove deep into:

-   **DOM Manipulation**: Learned to manipulate the page structure with JavaScript, dynamically updating the timer and other visual elements.
-   **JavaScript Events**: Explored the power of events to create interactive controls (start, pause, reset buttons).
-   **JavaScript Time Logic**: Used functions like `setInterval` and `setTimeout` to manage the countdown and cycle transitions.
-   **LocalStorage**: (If applicable) Used to store user preferences or the current state, ensuring settings persist even after closing the browser.
-   **CSS**: To style the application, making it pleasant and functional.

## How to Run the Project: Quick Guide

Ahoy, code mariner! Ready to test this timer? Grab the helm, I'll guide you:

### Stocking the Ship

Ensure you have a modern web browser installed. Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox are recommended.

#### Navigating to the Project

1.  Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2.  Open the folder where the project was saved.
3.  You'll find a file named `index.html`. This is the starting point!

#### Hoisting the Sails

Double-click the `index.html` file. Voil√†! The Pomodoro project will open in your default browser, ready to help you focus.

#### Exploring the Code Islands

Open the project folder in your favorite code editor (like VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.).

You'll find the main files containing the code:

-   `script.js` (or similar name): Where the main timer logic, cycle control, and interactions happen.
-   `styles.css` (or similar name): Where the project's visual magic is created, with all the CSS styles that make the application shine.
-   `index.html`: The basic structure of the page.

#### Adjusting the Sails:

Feel free to explore, modify, and experiment with the code. Learning is in the journey!

#### Messages in a Bottle:

If you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an *issue* in this repository or get in touch.
